This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined. This is a common error in React Native, especially when dealing with asynchronous operations or data fetching.  For example, if you are trying to display data from an API call before the data has been fetched, you will get this error.  Another example is trying to access a nested property when a parent object is null.

```javascript
// Example:
const data = null;
console.log(data.property); // Throws TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'property')
```
